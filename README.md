# AdventOfCode2022
Hacks for https://adventofcode.com/2024 - trying to learn Rust (from (almost) scratch - forgot most of it from https://github.com/musmuris/adventOfCode2022) so will look a bit scrappy

* `watch 1` to run cargo watch to compile and test on changes
* `cargo run --bin day1`
* `cargo test --bin day1`
